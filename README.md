# Binary Complement

Simple Calculator for One and Two Binary Complement in decimal

### Theory
What is the ones' complement =>
The ones' complement of a binary number is the value obtained by inverting al the bits (swapping 0s and 1s).
The ones' complement arithmetic is a system in which negative numbers are represented by the inverse of the binary
representations of their corresponding positive numbers.

What is the two' complement =>
In two's-complement, negating a number is done by inverting (swapping 0s and 1s) all the bits and then adding
one to that result.

## Installation
### Prerequisites

In order to compile this project you will need to:
- Have installed [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com) configured for [c++](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp)

## How to build?

1. Clone project or download Zip-file and unzip it
2. Open terminal inside of the project
3. Digit `mingw32-make` - to run the Makefile
4. if you want to run the executable on the external terminal click `run.exe` or press f5 for starting the debugging.  

## How to use?

- For the binary number required for initialization you must enter the bits all together.
- The program will display the inserted binary number converted to decimal
